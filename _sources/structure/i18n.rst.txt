i18n
====

The **i18n** module provides support for internationalization, conversions between default NWN encodings
and UTF-8 (see below).

Philosophy
----------

The module follows the principles of `UTF-8
everywhere <https://utf8everywhere.org/>`__. Or in other words, ordinary
C++ string types, ``std::string``, ``std::string_view``, etc. *must* be
in UTF-8. The only exception are:

-  wide character types (``std::wstring``, ``u16string``, ``u32string``,
   etc) which are never used.
-  ``std::filesystem::path`` which is, per the standard, stored in
   native encoding. E.g., on Linux, UTF-8; on windows, UCS-2; etc. Some
   platform specific conversions to UTF-8 are therefore necessary.

There is *no* caching or fixed caching policies at this layer of the
library.

kernel service
--------------

The `Strings` kernel service provides access to dialog/custom TLKs and localized strings. It also provides a
mechanism for interning commonly used strings.

**Example - Intern a String**

.. code:: cpp

    auto str = nw::kernel::strings().intern("This is a Test");
    if(str == "This is a Test") {
       // This will occur
    }
